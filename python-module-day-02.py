# # Activity 01 - Student Turn - Quick Check-Up - üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì
# 
# Let‚Äôs start with a quick warm-up activity to get the Python juices flowing.
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# Create a simple Python program below that does the following:
# 
# * Prints "Hello User!"
# 
# * Then asks "What is your name?"
# 
# * Then responds "Hello &lt;user's name&gt;"
# 
# * Then asks: "What is your favorite number? "
# 
# * Then responds: "Your favorite number is lower than mine.", "Your favorite number is higher than mine.", or "Your favorite number is the same as mine!" depending on your favorite number.
# 
# 
# ## Hint
# 
# * Remember to cast your variables!

# Print Hello User!

# # Activity 03 - Student Turn - Kid in a Candy Store - üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì 
# 
# In this activity, you will create the code that a candy store will use in their state-of-the-art candy vending machine.
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# * Create a loop that prints all of the candies in the store to the terminal, with their index stored in brackets beside them.
# 
#   * For example: `"[0] Snickers"`
# 
# * Create a second loop that runs for a set number of times determined by the variable `allowance`.
# 
#   * For example: If allowance is equal to five, the loop should run five times.
# 
#   * Each time this second loop runs, take in a user's input, preferably a number, and then add the candy with the matching index to the variable `candy_cart`.
# 
#   * For example: If the user enters "0" as their input, "Snickers" should be added into the `candy_cart` list.
# 
# * Use another loop to print all of the candies selected to the terminal.
# 
# ## Bonus
# 
# Create a version of the code that allows a user to select as much candy as they want until they say they do not want any more.

# # Activity 04 - Student Turn - House of Pies - üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì  
# 
# In this activity, you will build an order form that displays a list of pies and then prompts users to make a selection. The form will continue to prompt for selections until the user decides to end the process.
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# * Create an order form that displays a list of pies to the user in the following way:
# 
# 
# ```
# Welcome to the House of Pies! Here are our pies:
# 
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# (1) Pecan, (2) Apple Crisp, (3) Bean, (4) Banoffee,  (5) Black Bun, (6) Blueberry, (7) Buko, (8) Burek,  (9) Tamale, (10) Steak
# ```
# 
# * Then, prompt the user to enter the number for the pie they would like to order.
# 
# * Immediately follow up their order with `Great! We'll have that <PIE NAME> right out for you`, and then ask if they would like to make another order. If so, repeat the process.
# 
# * Once the user is done purchasing pies, print the total number of pies ordered.
# 
# ## Bonus
# 
# * Modify the application so that at the conclusion of the transaction, the user's purchases are listed out, with the total pie count broken by _each_ pie. For example:
# 
# ```
# You purchased:
# 0 Pecan
# 0 Apple Crisp
# 0 Bean
# 2 Banoffee
# 0 Black Bun
# 0 Blueberry
# 0 Buko
# 0 Burek
# 0 Tamale

# # Activity 09 - Student Turn - Reading Comic Book Data - üë©‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüéì
# 
# 
# In this activity, you will create an application that searches the provided CSV file for a specific graphic novel title and then returns the title, publisher‚Äôs name, and the year it was published.
# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# * Prompt the user for the book title they‚Äôd like to search.
# 
# * Search through the `comic_books.csv` to find the user's book.
# 
# * If the CSV contains the user's title, then print out the title, the publisher name, and the year it was published.
# 
#   * For example: `"Alien was published by DC Comics in 2015"`.
# 
# * If the CSV does not contain the user's title, then print out a message telling them that their book could not be found.
# 
#     * Set a variable to `False` to check if we found the comic book.
# 
#     * In the `for` loop, change the variable to confirm that the comic book is found.

# 
# ## Instructions
# 
# * Create a Python application that reads in the data from the 2019 U.S. Census.
# 
# * Then, store the contents of `Place`, `Population`, `Per Capita Income`, and `Poverty Count` into Python Lists.
# 
# * Then, zip these lists together into a single tuple.
# 
# * Finally, write the contents of your extracted data into a CSV. Make sure to include the titles of these columns in your CSV.
# 
# ## Bonus
# 
# * Find the poverty rate (percentage of population living in poverty). Include this in your final output, converting the rate to a string and including a "%" at the end of the string.
# 
# * Parse the string associated with `Place`, separating it into `County` and `State`, so we can store both in separate columns.
# 
# ## Hints
# 
# * Windows users may get a `UnicodeDecodeError`. To avoid this, pass in `encoding="utf8"` as an additional parameter when reading in the file.
# 
# * As with many datasets, the file does not include the header line. Use the following list as a guide to the columns: "Place,Population,Median Age,Household Income,Per Capita Income,Employed Civilians,Unemployed Civilians,People in the Military,Poverty Count"
